			Enlightening. Green, red and infrared LEDs light up the blood vessels in
			the wrist, and photodiodes measure how much light is reflected back.
			Advanced algorithms then calculate the color of your blood, and this can
			be used to determine the amount of oxygen present.

		<h3>Google Pixel</h3>

		<p>
			Daylight savings time started in the US and Canada this past weekend, but
			it seems some Google Pixel phones didn’t actually make the switch due to a
			peculiar bug. Several reddit threads (h/t: 9to5Google) noted the issue, as
			some Pixel phones simply didn’t make a leap to the new time. It didn’t
			appear to be restricted to any specific model either, as owners of the
			Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, Pixel 4 series, Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G, and Pixel 5 all
			chimed in to report the issue
